  The air suddenly gets colder and you notice something white that is coating 
the ground ahead of you.

As you get closer you realize that it is snow. 

"Snow?"

"How this even possible...?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For as far as you can see ahead of you snow coats the ground and walls.
